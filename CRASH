1. add some widgets, I added four:

data/add_plugin.sh foo 6 2
data/add_plugin.sh foa 10 4
data/add_plugin.sh fob 10 2
data/add_plugin.sh foc 10 0

2. run the panel, switch in edit mode, move the mouse over the grid.
3. run the panel, switch out edit mode, move the mouse over the grid.
4. repeast 2-3, it shoudl happen soon (usually you don't even need to get to repeat it twice)
